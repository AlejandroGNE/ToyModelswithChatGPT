Prompt:

since I don't think there is an 'easy' way to make you remember this conversation, and you have learned so much valuable information in this session, I would like us to work on an way to 'make you remember'
given all the python scripts, PLEXOS API functions, and more 'fundamental tasks' we've covered throughout this chat, can you put together a single text or script, narrating everything you have learned today:
how to use PLEXOS API to write code that builds, modifies, and runs PLEXOS models
what are the 'fundamental tasks' or building blocks of the PLEXOS API; think, some tasks are like atoms, and some others are like molecules: combinations of more fundamental tasks, in the context of PLEXOS model-building
what are essential actions that must be done when dealing with PLEXOS API e.g., what packages must be loaded and/or imported (and other actions that are *always* part of working with PLEXOS)
what are the best practices when writing PLEXOS API code, to ensure it is readable by humans and to ensure it maximizes the ability of LLMs to learn from it to build plexos models using PLEXOS API python code
think: should you forget your memory, what information you would like to see to remember everything you learned today, and recover your well-earned python expert, LLM fine-tuning expert identity?

Response:

Sure, here is a comprehensive text that encapsulates all the critical aspects and insights learned about using the PLEXOS API to write Python code for building, modifying, and running PLEXOS models. This document serves as a complete reference guide and best practices manual.

# Using PLEXOS API for Building, Modifying, and Running PLEXOS Models in Python

## Introduction

This document provides a detailed guide on how to use the PLEXOS API to write Python code for building, modifying, and running PLEXOS models. It covers the fundamental tasks, essential actions, and best practices necessary for efficient and effective interaction with the PLEXOS API.

## Essential Setup and Imports

When working with the PLEXOS API, certain packages and assemblies must be loaded and imported to enable the interaction between Python and the PLEXOS .NET environment.

### Loading PLEXOS Assemblies

```python
import os
import sys
import clr
from datetime import datetime
from shutil import copyfile

# Load PLEXOS assemblies
plexos_path = 'C:/Program Files/Energy Exemplar/PLEXOS 10.0 API'
sys.path.append(plexos_path)
clr.AddReference('PLEXOS_NET.Core')
clr.AddReference('EEUTILITY')
clr.AddReference('EnergyExemplar.PLEXOS.Utility')

# .NET related imports
from PLEXOS_NET.Core import DatabaseCore
from EEUTILITY.Enums import *
from EnergyExemplar.PLEXOS.Utility.Enums import *
from System import DateTime, String, Int32, Double
```

## Fundamental Tasks (Building Blocks)
